This document describes what each directory in this project is.  Please turn word wrapping on, or you wont be able to read this.

Common:
    The projects contained in this folder are classes used in more than one project.  For example, threading is used in SkyWrite-Core and Notebook-Core.
    
    Common_classes
        Classes contained in here are common throughout the repo.  This is a level higher than the os layer, and should be built after the os layer is built.  Classes in here should be programmed such that they are cross platform, that is, C/C++.
    
    debug_new:
        debug_new is a memory leak detector.  For platforms with valgrind, this really isnt needed.  On platforms without valgrind (win32), then debug_new is needed to detect memory leaks.  Building the project inside of here makes a static library of debug_new.  For win32 users, the debug_new lib is already included inside of Skyvo's MinGW compiler.
    
    math:
        Common math functions.  Ignore for now, as its out of date.  Ideally, this language should be as cross platform as possible.  That is, C.  If C is not feasable, C++.

    Common/os:
        This is platform specific os calls.  This includes threading and filesystem calls.  The implementation of these classes can be platform-specific, but should be abstracted in a way to be cross-platform.  This is the lowest level, and should be built first.  The language is C++, unless other platforms required a different language (they must, however, be wrapped so c++ can call them).    

    rapidxml:
        xml parser written in c++.  This is a library we found online.
        
    SCSV:
        Us at skyvo disliked CSV as a format, so we created our own standard called Skyvo CSV (SCSV).  This project contains the SCSV parser.  The language is C++.
