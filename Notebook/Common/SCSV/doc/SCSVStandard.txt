SCSV Standard:

SCSV is like regular CSV, excpet for a few modifications.  Standard CSV implies each row must be of the same length:
a,b,c
d,e,f
g,h,i

SCSV states that the rows can be of different sizes:

a,b,c,d
e,f
g,,h


Notes about the standard:
Each line must end with a \n.  Therefore there must be an empty line (NO CHARACTERS) at the end of the file.  
An empty line anywhere else is assumed to be a row with one blank cell (these lines have \n in them, not just EOF)
,,     value means an empty cell

Amps and commas are not allowed in a cell.  Use these instead:
&amp; = &
&comma; = ,

example:

strokeIndex
x,y,P
x,y,P
EOF
