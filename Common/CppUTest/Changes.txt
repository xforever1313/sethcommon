These are the changes made to CppUTest that needed to be done to be compatible
with this repo.

1.  The directory was rearranged.  This was so CppUTest could be build with
our build system.

2.  The build, builds, cmake, examples, lib, project, scripts folders were all
scrapped, as they are not needed for Skyvo.

3. Modified include/CppUTest/Extensions/SimpleStringExtensions.h and
src/CppUTest/Extensions/SimpleStringExtensions so it could support unsigned
int.

4.  Renamed include/CppUTest/Extensions/SimpleStringFromStdint.h to
SimpleStringFromStdint.h.backup, as it would not work with our build system.
Did something similar with src/CppUTest/Extensions/SimpleStringFromStdint.cpp

5.  Removed several files we deemed unneeded.  Including, but not limited to
INSTALL, ChangeLog, CMakeLists.txt, configure, etc.

6.  Added skyvoTestMain.cpp.  This is not part of CppUTest.  It is used as the
main for all unit tests, and it was determined this was the most convient
folder to put it in.
