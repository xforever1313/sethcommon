How to create and modify a Doxyfile

A Doxyfile is what doxygen uses to generate its documentation.  Here are the steps to create one correctly.

Remeber to make sure doxygen/bin is in your path

1.  Go to a project root, where the SConstruct is located.
2.  On the command line, run "doxygen -g"
3.  A Doxyfile should appear.  Go ahead and open this file up in your favorite text editor.
4.  Modify the following fields (I recommend using CTRL+F to find these).  Put each parameter in quotes.
    a. PROJECT_NAME (usually what the folder is called)
    b. PROJECT_BRIEF (A description of the project)
    c. PROJECT_LOGO (Have this point to our logo, located in doc/SkyvoLogo.png. Relative paths are allowed)
    d. OUTPUT_DIRECTORY (set this to "doc/doxygen")
    e. INPUT (located around line 664) 
        Put the directories of wherever there is a hearder or source file in the project, including any unit tests. For most projects, you need a minimum of this:
        INPUT = "./include" "./src" "./Test" "./Test/include" "./Test/src"
        NOTE:  Everytime a folder is added that contains source code, this needs to be updated.
        Set RECURSIVE to "YES"
    f. GENERATE_HTML (set to YES if it isn't already)
    g. GENERATE_LATEX (set to NO if it isn't already)
    h. GENERATE_RTF (set to NO if it isn't already)
    i. GENERATE_XML (set to NO if it isn't already)
    j. GENERATE_PERLMOD (set to NO if it isn't already)
5.  Modify the SConstruct such that it can create a doxygen target.  SConstructGlobals.py has a method that makes this easy.
6.  Run "scons doxygen"  Check the doc folder and ensure that a doxygen folder is there.
7.  Open doc/doxygen/index.html, and ensure everything is there that you expected to be
8.  Add doc/doxygen to the git ignore list (on TortoiseGit, right click on doc/doxygen, TortoiseGit->add to ignore list->doxygen, and select the .gitignore in the root directory)
9. Commit the Doxyfile and the SConstruct if you made changes to it.
